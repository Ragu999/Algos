typedef struct employee{
char name[20];
int marks;
}emp;

int main()
{
emp a[5];
int i,j,cut;
printf("\nEnter the cutoff\n");
scanf("%d",&cut);
printf("\n ------------------------------\n");

for(i=0;i<5;i++){
printf("Enter Name:");
fflush(stdout);
scanf("%s",a[i].name);
printf("Enter Marks");
fflush(stdout);
scanf("%d",&a[i].marks);
printf("\n ------------------------------\n");
}
for(i=0;i<5;i++){

if(a[i].marks>=cut){

printf("\nThe Students who are selected along with thier marks for the interview are:\n");
printf("%s\t",a[i].name);
